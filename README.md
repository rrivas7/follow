### User flow
With Follow you can select from a list of (admin-maintained) 'followees', aka well-known people. Follow provides a list of articles regarding/mentioning the person you've selected to follow.

To update your settings:
* In the upper right, there's a link `'Edit Profile'`
* Form appears with a dropdown, `'Followee'`
* Make sure to enter your current password, for a proper save.

### Libs/tools used
* Devise for auth, session, and registration
 * Most of the views were first generated by devise, but I tweaked
 * Confirmation emails will not work currently, since mailer is not set up
* Sidekiq for async jobs
* Rspec for testing
* Bootstrap for quick styling

### Notes
* Used Devise installation to generate views/controllers, but tweaked a fair bit
* Confirmation emails will not work currently, since mailer is not set up, so I'd recommend seeding the db to use the user created there instead of signing up via the front end:
 * email: user@example.com, password: abc123
* Using a developer key for News API - so keep in mind, that the requests can max out.
* News api gem worked for the most part, but was a little outdated since it did not parse `'content'` for the article, so went with manually calling the api.
* Thought it would be better to restrict the possibilities of 'followees', for a more consistent search on the api.

### Install dependencies
```
bundle
```

### DB setup
Using PostgreSQL as the db adapter
```
bin/rails db:create
bin/rails db:migrate

# or use db:schema_load via db:setup
bin/rails db:setup

# Populate your db with the seed file
bin/rails db:seed
```

### How to run tests
Using `rspec` for the test suite:
```
bundle exec rspec
```

### Scheduled news api job
We can kick off a job that currently would run every 10 minutes.

__Note: currently using a developer api key that will max out on API requests__
```
bundle exec sidekiq
```

### How to update credentials
We're maintaining the News API key via credentials:
```
bin/rails credentials:edit
```
